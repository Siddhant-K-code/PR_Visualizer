# PR Visualizer

## Inspiration:

Github has grown to become the most popular repositories host worldwide where most open source projects developement take place, developpers around the world are able to contribute their code by submitting pull requests.
However, when it comes to Github's pull requests User Interface, we agree that essential features are missing like the rate of closed/merged and the total of pull requests aren't easily retrievable, thus we've created **PR_Visualizer**, a react app using the Github api and presents a better UI/UX for most PRs insights as an alternative to Github's PR UI.

## Contributing

You can contribute to PR_Visualizer but ask contributors to follow standard git branches naming conventions, thus if you're on working on a feature ```feat``` solving the ```issue #12``` the we ask contributors to name their branch ```12-feat-user``` and submit their pull request to the ```development``` branch.
